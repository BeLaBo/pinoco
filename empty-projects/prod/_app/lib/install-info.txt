NOTE: Installing PHPTAL
If you still not install PHPTAL, you can put PHPTAL components here.

NOTE: Installing Pinoco
If you still not install Pinoco, you can put Pinoco components here,
and you must change the require_once statement in _gateway.php to point here.
  e.g.
    require_once "_app/lib/Pinoco.php"


ALTERNATIVE INSTALL:
If PHP5.3 or above you can use Composer to install Pinoco and PHPTAL.
  $ cd _app
  $ php composer.phar install

Then replace require statement in _gateway.php from
    require_once "_app/lib/Pinoco.php"
to
    require '_app/vendor/.composer/autoload.php';
